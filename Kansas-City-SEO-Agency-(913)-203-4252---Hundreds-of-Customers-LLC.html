Hundreds of Customers LLC, an SEO company based in Overland Park, Kansas is seeking to turn that paradigm on its head, By offering a safe, “white hat,” and low-cost SEO service that is guaranteed to put clients on page one of the search engines in under 72 hours.More information is available on their website: http://hundredsofcustomers.com/guaranteed-seo-services/Search engine giant Google purportedly processes around 40 to 50 thousand searches every single second. That is about 3.5 billion searches every single day and 1.2 trillion searches over the course of a year. Replacing tools like the Yellow Pages, the search engines have redefined and shaped the way consumers learn about and find businesses and services that they need. Because of this paradigm shift, and the fact that as many as 95% of searchers never move beyond the first page of the search engine results page, many businesses are eager to be found on web page one. “That’s Google’s entire business model,” says Justin West, the founder and CEO of A huge selection of Customers, “Page one traffic is very valuable, and they make over $200 million dollars a day letting people pay to get on page one via their AdWords pay-per-click platform. Of program, to the companies that are ‘lucky’ enough to be naturally on web page one, they see the biggest benefit of this entire process - and that’s why so many people are wanting to get to the organically-already-on-page-one spots in the SERPs (search engine pages). That’s how the entire industry of search engine optimization (SEO) was created.”West shared a “short history” of SEO, saying “The reason Google has entered the lexicon - the reason we ‘google’ things - is because they give the best search results. People figured out that the algorithm that drove Google was primarily looking at inbound links to a site and the anchor text of those links, and they started to ‘monkey’ with the SERPs using inbound link building techniques that ultimately amounted to spam. One of the most famous moments in internet spam came when enough folks hyperlinked the phrase ‘miserable failure’ and directed it to the official White House biography of President George W. Bush so that it was the number one search result for that phrase. It was funny, no matter how you felt about him politically - but Google realized that if people could easily monkey with the SERPs, then people would be less inclined to trust Google search results, and they’d lose their market dominance (and all the AdWords revenue that comes with it).“So Google tweaked the algorithm, and professional SEOs did their best to figure out the changes and re-implement them. Wash; rinse; repeat.” West went on to state that, “SEO is about building your brand - often artificially. Google loves brands, and brands take a long time to build. SEO traditionally is about creating the artifice of being an authoritative brand when it’s unearned. Google will always seek to prevent that from happening. That’s why what we do is so radically different - we’re not trying to artificially make you look like a brand. Rather, we’re trying to leverage already existing brands and get them to talk about you and publish positive content about you that effectively ranks overnight because of their established power, and yet over time builds you up as a brand, and increases where you are seen because you slowly become a brand through this process.”West’s company, Hundreds of Customers LLC, seeks to help their clients rank through the use of Media Campaigns, of which West went on to state that, “just last month we were able to help a personal injury attorney in New York City reach page one of Google - in the number 1 spot - over 1,000 times.” “We have a network of around 500 established news media partners - these include network affiliates of ABC, NBC, CBS, and FOX, and range from Boston to Miami to Honolulu, and all points in between. It works incredibly well because we’re leveraging the power and authority of currently existing brands - which makes this pretty much guaranteed SEO.<br><br><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3103.617601077203!2d-94.6941016846486!3d38.93271697956524!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x87c0eaeeaaaaaaab%3A0xc18b34955f3b0212!2sHundreds+of+Customers+LLC!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1530553527919" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p><a href="https://azureleader.blob.core.windows.net/azureleader/Kansas-City-SEO-Agency-(913)-203-4252---Hundreds-of-Customers-LLC.html">guaranteed seo</a><br> <a href="https://azureleader.blob.core.windows.net/azureleader/Kansas-City-SEO-Agency-(913)-203-4252---Hundreds-of-Customers-LLC.html">SEO</a><br> <a href="https://azureleader.blob.core.windows.net/azureleader/Kansas-City-SEO-Agency-(913)-203-4252---Hundreds-of-Customers-LLC.html">search engine optimization</a><br> <a href="https://azureleader.blob.core.windows.net/azureleader/Kansas-City-SEO-Agency-(913)-203-4252---Hundreds-of-Customers-LLC.html">guaranteed search engine optimization</a><br> <a href="https://azureleader.blob.core.windows.net/azureleader/Kansas-City-SEO-Agency-(913)-203-4252---Hundreds-of-Customers-LLC.html">kansas city seo agency</a><br> <a href="https://azureleader.blob.core.windows.net/azureleader/Kansas-City-SEO-Agency-(913)-203-4252---Hundreds-of-Customers-LLC.html">overland park seo agency</a><br> </p><br></body><br></html>
