"But the good news is, a mowing business needs fewer employees than other green businesses like landscaping . So your chances of finding enough people are not that bad." </p>  <p> Establishing Prices Before you can make an estimate, you have to know how much to charge per square foot. Since the lawn care industry is so competitive, it's important not to overprice your services. The professional organizations and publications that serve the lawn care industry may be able to help, because many of them conduct annual member studies. In particular, you may find Lawn & Landscape magazine's State of the Industry Report, which appears in its October issue, to be particularly enlightening. </p>  <p> The division is doing well, Foret says. “The few clients that we are doing this work for keep us very busy, and this is definitely a service we will put some time and effort in the future to grow,” he says. </p>  <h3> How I Charge Landscaping Jobs Hourly Vs By The Job - Prices </h3>  <p> One struggle he’s facing is bidding against design/build firms that dole out free designs to win jobs. Cauffman subcontracts his design work. He is hiring freelancers that he has to pay, so freebie designs just aren’t possible if he plans to make a profit (and he does). “I have to figure out how to get a professional design to clients without it costing me an arm and a leg,” he says. </p>  <h4> How Much Does Landscaping Cost? </h4>  <p> Of course, there are many other plant-related businesses that might be of interest to landscapers, including silviculturist (someone who specializes in the care of trees, especially relating to forests), horticulturist (a person who investigates better ways to grow, harvest and store fruits, vegetables and ornamental plants), and turf specialist (someone who cares for turf and sod). You can find an extensive list of horticulture and landscape design-related businesses on the Vocational Information Guide website at www.khake.com/page21.html. </p>  <p> That was OK in fall 2008 because of backlog, and 2009 was strong due to a few anomalies: a big snow season, that business purchase (which added recurring revenue accounts), plus a large installation job that continued from the prior year and kept Dave’s busy through fall 2009. </p>  <h3> How To Start A Lawn Care Or Landscaping Business  </h3>  <p> Experts recommend pricing based on lawn size. It's less arbitrary to set up a pricing structure this way, plus you'll seem more professional to your prospects if you have an established, formal price structure. You can compensate for unusual land features by building an extra amount-say, 10 percent-into your price. </p>  <p> But you can also figure out how much the market will bear by calculating the size of your own lot and calling a few of the lawn care companies in the Yellow Pages for an estimate. (Typically, owners of lawn care services calculate their prices based on the total square footage of the lot. They can usually estimate roughly how much of a lot is landscaping.) Then recruit a few family members and friends to call for quotes on their lawns, too, so you can get a feel for prices on lots of different sizes. This will help you determine the acceptable price range in your community, and then it's easy to figure out where to price your services. This method works especially well if you're doing business in a community with uniformly platted subdivisions or other similarly sized lots. </p>  <h4> What Does Landscaping Company Do </h4>  <p> A Day in the Life While your reason for entering the landscaping field may be to get your hands dirty as you beautify American one home at a time, you'll have a lot of other duties you also must attend to as the owner of a newly minted small business. Some of the office tasks you'll handle during a typical workday include: </p>  <h3> Company Landscaping Questions </h3>  <p> Your estimate should outline the exact services you're offering, the materials you'll provide and anything else pertinent to the job. And by the way, your estimate should be provided free of charge, as that's the standard in the landscaping industry. </p>  <p> The rental market in Florida is booming. Buildings are full. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT) buy up foreclosed properties to hold and/or lease need landscaping services, too. Today, Ameriscape Services in the Tampa Bay area is servicing about 500 homes per week for REITs. Last year, the firm did no business in this sector. </p>  <h4> How Much Does A Lawn Mowing Service Company Charge? </h4>  <p> Landscape architect/designer: Planning verdant spaces is the job of the landscape architect (aka landscape designer). Landscape architects often work side by side with building architects, surveyors and engineers to design and plan projects like new subdivisions, public parks, college campuses, shopping centers, golf courses and industrial parks, and then produce detailed drawings to pull the projects together. They may specialize in a certain type of project, such as waterfront development, site construction, or environmental remediation (e.g., preserving wetlands). Landscape architects also play an important role in historic landscape preservation and restoration. </p>  <p> But playing a conservative hand has been crucial in maintaining the business since 2008. For example, Rykbost has been repairing equipment rather than making purchases. Not until recently has he added to his mower fleet. Last year, he replaced six mowers, and he ordered a couple more this season (all propane). And, he’s shopping for trucks again. This comes after a few years of steady-as-she-goes. </p>  <h4>  </h4>  <p> In 2008, Marsan’s business had the best year in its history. Back then, the operation was 75 percent construction and 25 percent maintenance/snow. Today, that business model has flip-flopped. Three-quarters of revenues come from recurring services after an aggressive shift in 2009 toward commercial maintenance. </p>  <p> Now, REITs are about 30 percent of Ameriscape’s business. The company is going to do at least a half-million dollars this year from these clients. Meanwhile, Ameriscape also expanded into municipal work, capturing a significant contract with the City of Tampa. </p>  <p> Estimating Jobs Whether you're providing a simple service like pruning bushes or you're installing an elaborate three-level deck, people will want to know upfront how much a job will cost. As a result, it's imperative to develop good estimating skills right from the start. The trouble is, estimating is a science, and it's simple to make a misstep that could cost you plenty in terms of time and resources. </p>  <p> Finding qualified help can be a real challenge. While mowing or planting doesn't necessarily take a great deal of technical skill, it is hard work, and it's work that's often done under uncomfortably warm conditions. It also takes a fair amount of physical stamina and the ability to handle power tools deftly without amputating useful body parts. So what on earth would make someone take on such a demanding job when he or she could sell designer shoes at the mall or call out mystery game numbers at the bowling alley? </p>  <h3> How Much Does A Landscape Design Consultation Cost?  </h3>  <p> Diversity has been crucial for Ameriscape because its core business - the multi-family world - was bombarded with competition since the market was so ripe. “It’s very cutthroat. I’ll tell you, that market is a blood bath now,” says Joe Chiellini, president. “No one can buy a house, so they have to rent,” he continues. “From a business st, point and the competition for multi-family and st contracts has been tough.” </p>  <h4> How Much Does A Landscaping Company Charge  </h4>  <p> There are numerous ways you can forge a business in either residential or commercial landscaping-or both. Some of the fields require more than just a love of gardening to succeed-they also require experience and formal education. The major career paths for landscapers include: </p>  <p> There are a number of software packages (like CLIP and LandPro) developed specifically for landscapers that you can use to help you make good estimates. We've also listed the names of a few books in the Appendix that you might find helpful. In the meantime, here is a general overview of how to go about making an educated guess. </p>  <p> Percentage of Project Cost: High-end landscape architects sometimes charge a percentage of the project cost. For example, if your project costs $30,000, they may charge you a design fee of fifteen to twenty percent, or $4,500-$6,000. </p>  <p> Meanwhile, the company did not get its H-2B labor back. Rykbost had to pull from the domestic labor pool, which was growing thanks to rising unemployment. “But it would have been nice to have the guys we had for the last several years who knew what they were doing,” he says. </p>  <p> So Ameriscape has diversified heavily. There’s no loyalty in the multi-family market, he says, even if Chiellini gave them a price break during the recession. When a lower priced bid lands on the desk of a property owner, guess who wins? </p>  <p> Once you have the designs, you can choose to do the landscaping on your own, if you have experience and the proper supplies. Or you might prefer to hire a landscaping contractor to give your yard its fresh new look. </p>  <p> The typical startup lawn care business services 20 to 30 residential clients a week and offers up to three types of services: mowing, fertilizing and chemical application and mowing.} For the purpose of the lawn care part of this book, we'll focus on mowing and fertilizing, since chemical applications (herbicides, pesticides and fungicides) are a whole industry unto themselves. It's also a closely regulated industry that requires practitioners to earn certifications that permit them to handle these hazardous compounds. </p>  <p> BP was a big-spender with Foret Contracting Group in Thibodaux, La., following the oil spill in 2010. Foret Group already had BP as a client. But that year, revenues swelled to $7 million. (Today, it does about $3.5 million.) </p>  <p> Finally this year, the company has a backlog. “We are starting to put a high concentrate on construction and installation services,” Strauser says of the primarily maintenance and snow business. Currently, recurring service work is 75 percent. Five years ago, 75 percent of the business was installation. </p>  <p> Of course, in the end it doesn't matter how you arrive at your rate as long as you make enough money to meet your monthly obligations. So when you figure out your rate, think about how much you need to pay the business bills and cover your personal expenses (including the mortgage, health insurance and other household bills). When you can pay all the bills and still have some cash left over to funnel back into the business or salt away in a business account, then you've priced your services appropriately. </p>  <p> Gardener/groundskeeper: This type of green industry professional is usually in charge of keeping up appearances-he or she may care for plants and other greenery, and may perform that work in a garden, greenhouse or work shed. What sets gardeners and groundskeepers apart from other landscape professionals is that they normally don't do any design work; rather, they tend existing landscapes, although they may render other services like applying pesticides and herbicides, mowing lawns, doing spring and fall cleanups, composting, etc. They need a good working knowledge of horticulture and plant varieties. </p>  <p> “We made the bet that things would turn around,” says Chris Clifton of his approach to business the last five years. In 2009, Southview Design in Minneapolis did $4.7 million. “We are on track to do $12 million this year.” </p>  <p> There are many ways to determine your rate. First, you can compare your prices to those of your competition. Enlist the help of friends and family to help you contact companies in your target market area that offer services similar to what you plan to offer. If you're doing business in an area that has a lot of subdivisions with similar-size homes and lots, the process will be relatively easy. </p>  <p> Your mission here is to determine what your costs will be and then add in a profit. Your costs will include everything from materials (plants, mulch, topsoil, etc., which you have marked up from your wholesale or retail price) to labor (both your own employees and subcontractors), equipment (yours and any you rent), and your general business overhead (anything you plan to claim as the cost of doing business, such as home office expenses, gasoline, etc.). </p> |How Much Does A Landscaping Company Charge <p> Setting Prices Of course, before you can give an estimate, you have to come up with a price you can use as a baseline. Landscaping professionals recommend coming up with an hourly rate, both for yourself and your employees. But you won't be sharing that rate with your customers-it's for your eyes only, so you can figure out how much to charge for a job. </p>  <p> Here are snapshots from across the country - stories that illustrate how landscape businesses were faring in 2008 before the crash, how they responded in those dark times, and why the last five years have changed these companies forever. Sure, we all have a few signs of aging thanks to this economic recession. But most of us look in the mirror and see a more distinguished, wise and mature business that’s ready to face the future. </p>  <p> The recession really caused no tug on the business. “We feel like we were a little bit insulated from the recession because the predominant business in southern Louisiana is oil field related,” Foret says. </p>  <h4> How Much Does A Landscaping Company Charge </h4>  <p> A different approach to assigning roles in the organization has drawn in talent. Rather than hiring a landscape designer who also sells, manages projects and serves as a project foreman, these roles are broken down into separate jobs. “That way, people can focus on the parts of the chain they are good at, so our average competency level for any given function in the business has gone up,” he says. “It’s the best team with the best players.” </p>  <p> It's crucial to the survival of your business to keep all your equipment in peak working condition. That means cleaning the mower blades at the end of each day and using a grinding wheel regularly to keep them sharp. You should also use a balancing weight to prolong engine life and to help prevent white finger, a form of Raynaud's disease caused by exposure to constant vibration from equipment like lawn mowers. Clean oil and air filters regularly to keep engine wear to a minimum and improve performance. The oil should also be changed often-as often as once a week, since the high heat of the mower causes lubricants to break down fast. </p>  <h4> How Much Does A Landscape Design Consultation Cost?  </h4>  <p> Landscapers come in all shapes, sizes and backgrounds, but they all share one thing in common: a genuine love of the outdoors and growing things. It's what drives them to spend the majority of every day on the job covered in dirt. It induces them to learn the Latin names of plants, shrubs and trees-on purpose. And it makes them gleefully haul around 45-gallon containers (and the redwoods sprouting from them) like it's child's play instead of actual work. Sound like fun? Then you've come to the right place. </p>  <h3> How Much Does Landscaping Cost?  </h3>  <p> But Foret Group has carefully watched and learned from the last five years of financial strife throughout the country. The firm is focused on diversifying its procedure and growing its capability to serve as a total facility manager. “We want to be the one-stop shop for clients,” Foret says of the group’s general contracting and facility maintenance division. </p>  <p> Of course, Marsan didn’t expect the bottom to drop out when he merged with another company about 20 percent of his firm’s size. So that bounce to commercial was a survival tactic, and one that stuck. As for the partnership, it helped the business stay strong during tough times. “We knew two different networks, so that was a great opportunity for us to mesh our customer capacity,” Marsan says. </p>  <h4> How I Charge Landscaping Jobs Hourly Vs By The Job - Prices </h4>  <p> Incidentally, while you don't want to be the most expensive service in town, you don't have to undercut the competition to get jobs, either. Pricing your services somewhere in the middle or toward the top of the range is a good rule of thumb. Then it's up to you to demonstrate that your professionalism, quality service and reliability set you apart from the competition and justify a higher price than the cheapest kid on the block. </p>  <p> Finally, you can figure your rate based on how much money you'd like to make in a given year. For example, if your goal is to make $40,000 during your first year in business, you need to earn approximately $3,334 per month ($40,000 divided by 12). If you want to work 35 hours a week, a four-week month would be 140 hours a month. Divide $3,334 by 140 to arrive at a rate of $23.81 per hour. You can mark that cost up (or at least round it up), then add in your profit margin. Naturally, your cost of doing business, which includes materials, tool costs and office administration costs, would be billed to customers in addition to this hourly rate. </p>  <h3> How To Start A Lawn Care Or Landscaping Business </h3>  <p> “If the recession would have happened during our first five years of business, we would not be here, I think,” he says. “My drive and money saving got us through everything. So, now we are trying to replicate that (work ethic) but be smarter than we were in our first decade of business.” </p>  <h4> Company Landscaping Questions </h4>  <p> Three weeks after Marsan merged with a neighboring landscape firm in 2009 - expecting that combining forces, networks and talent would position the company for success during the downturn - the fresh new entity lost $1 million in business. Just like that. </p>  <h3>  </h3>  <p> And Cauffman would also like to edge away from residential clients and take on more commercial work. For now, up to 70 percent of his clients are homeowners. “I’m telling you, they take 10 quotes on you and … it’s really tough.” Cauffman says GreenRoots is on track internally to support commercial clientele; it’s only a matter of pursuing the work. </p>  <p> But lawn care is a service that makes the cut in tough times. Vacations got trimmed and so did large design-build projects. “But you’ve got to keep the grass alive to protect your property investment,” he says. </p>  <h3> How Much Does A Lawn Mowing Service Company Charge?  </h3>  <p> Because Chiellini has worked in the multi-family market for so long, he has relationships with property managers, some of whom moved over to work at REITs. “They reached out to us, and we saw a niche,” he says. </p>  <p> Then there were companies that admit they were somewhat insulated from the economic catastrophe because of their market, their customer base or complete anomalies - a good snow, a lucky break with a multi-millionaire client, good timing. Of course, many companies didn’t survive this. And to be fair, the story you’re reading is a bit skewed because we talked to landscapers who are still in business. Survivors. The ones who had to cut back, invest their personal savings to keep things alive or who were positioned to eat up market share in vulnerable times. </p>  <h4> What Does Landscaping Company Do </h4>  <p> If you want to make sure your landscape contractor is in line with his or her pricing, ask them how many days the project will take from start to finish. Then do your math at $4,000 per day, and if they are in that vicinity, then their pricing is on the right track.   </p>  <p> Grass Attack Basic lawn maintenance consists of mowing, edging and trimming and mowing.} Often, bush and hedge trimming is offered as an extra service, but it's more time-consuming and requires more manual dexterity than mowing. Lawn businesses sometimes send out two people to a job site so one person can do the mowing while the other edges and trims the areas the mower can't reach. But if you're an one-man (or one-woman) band, you'll just have to allot extra time on each site to complete both jobs. Fortunately, not all lawns have to be edged every time you mow. Sometimes only minor touch-ups are necessary, which you can do utilizing a hand edger. </p> |How Much Does A Landscaping Company Charge  <p> Who Are the Customers ? Who's driving this industry? The 77 million aging baby boomers, many of whom are affluent homeowners. They recognize the value of a well-kept lawn and beautifully designed and landscaped yard, however they often don't have the time or the inclination to do the maintenance themselves. </p>  <p> Clifton made sure that homeowners recognized Southview’s name. He credits his company’s growth to assertive promotion efforts - a combination of radio, TV, newspaper, magazine and direct mail - along with creating a sought-after company culture. “We are absolutely leaner now,” he adds. </p>  <h3> How Much Does A Landscaping Company Charge </h3>  <p> “I put all my life savings into the business.” Zech Strauser didn’t pull back during the recession. Instead, he put his financial life on the line and pulled about $300,000 from his personal savings to invest in a new facility for Strauser Nature’s Helpers in East Stroudsburg, Pa. </p>  <h4> What Does Landscaping Company Do </h4>  <p> General Business Operations While you have many choices when customizing your new landscaping business, there are certain tasks that you'll need to do no matter which services you decide to offer. They include the following. </p>  <p> In case you did fall off your chair, remember that the trade-off for shelling out the big bucks is that, like Bowers, you won't have to spend a lot of time advertising, interviewing and hiring and advertising.} But you don't necessarily have to pay that much to get the same excellent results. The Occupational Outlook Handbook 2006-07 (U.S. Department of Labor) reports that the median hourly wage for landscaping and groundskeeping laborers was $9.82, which you could round up to $10 or down to $9.50. If that's a little too high for your startup budget, you could instead offer at least $2 above minimum wage since it's hard to find unskilled jobs that pay that well. </p>  <h3> How I Charge Landscaping Jobs Hourly Vs By The Job - Prices </h3>  <p> Incidentally, weather can impact your business in one more way. "Sometimes I have to tell customers when it's time to do certain jobs," says Collins of Celtic Lawn & Landscape. "For example, last fall I had a lot of customers who wanted their leaves raked. One kept putting off the job, so I encouraged him to do it sooner rather than later, because if I had waited until he wanted me to come out, there would have been 3 inches of snow on the ground." </p>  <h3> How Much Does A Lawn Mowing Service Company Charge? </h3>  <p> But Ameriscape held on strong during the last five years. And in the last year, the company has staged a strategic growth spurt thanks to new REIT business. The opportunity in this market is huge in Florida and other states that were hit hard by foreclosures, including Arizona and California. The largest REIT in Chiellini’s market has 3,000 properties in the Tampa Bay area. “They are writing leases on these houses just like they are apartment complexes,” he says. </p>  <p> Office administration: Besides answering the phone and e-mail, you'll have mail to open and bills to send out and pay. If you decide to accept credit cards, you'll also have to process those credit cards through your merchant account. (You'll find information about merchant accounts in a later chapter.) It can take a substantial amount of time to do the books, says Livonia, Michigan, landscape business co-owner Karen Deighton. She spends about three hours a week keeping up with the financial side of the business-and she holds a degree in mathematics. If you're numerically challenged, you might want to hire an accountant. </p>  <h3>  </h3>  <p> “I feel like I just went through the ‘Biggest Loser’ where we show up, we don’t know what to do and by the time we’re done, we come out feeling great and ready to roll,” says Russ Marsan, owner of Carpenter & Costin in Rutl and Vt. “I just feel like a whole different person.” </p>  <p> And as for now - and 2014? Last year, the company finally hit the $2.2 million mark, a goal Marsan set in 2009. “It took us this long to get back to that point, and it was a long road,” he says. This year could look like $2.5 to $2.75 million. With a branch office open in New Hampshire, there are two locations and more opportunity for growth. “It’s going to be even better,” he says of the future. </p>  <h4> Company Landscaping Questions </h4>  <p> Meanwhile, revenues are finally reaching pre-recession levels, Strauser says. He expects to match the company’s 2007 numbers, which were its highest. The company has been growing an average of 10 to 15 percent. “We haven’t had one flat year,” Strauser says. But that growth has come from maintenance, which yields smaller profit margins and lower-dollar sales. “That was good for cash infusion and more steady growth each month, which I’m all for,” he says. </p>  <p> Meanwhile, Lawn Dawg captured opportunity to expand into new markets through organic growth and acquiring operations. Its footprint has increased from five to 10 branches in the last four years. “There were some really nice strategic opportunities out there,” Campanella says. </p>  <h3> How To Start A Lawn Care Or Landscaping Business  </h3>  <p> Even so, to sustain operations and take advantage of market opportunities, he relied on his own cash to fund growth during the recession. “At least it’s equity in property - it’s not like I lost that money,” he says, adding that building up that savings again will take time. But at least the business is healthy. </p>  <h4> How Much Does Landscaping Cost? </h4>  <p> The owners interviewed for this book charge anywhere from $20 to $85 per cut. Others charge a flat rate like $100 per month or $40 per hour. All of them base their estimates on a visual inspection of the property, and some measured the mowing area as described above. </p>  <h4> How Much Does A Landscape Design Consultation Cost? </h4>  <p> Interiorscaper (aka interior landscaper): You can build an entire business caring for plants in office buildings, shopping malls and other public places. Interior landscapers are usually contractors who provide general maintenance and care, as well as give advice about the types of plants and planters that will complement a building's interior design the best. Interiorscapers often give advice about plant selection, supervise and/or set up or tear down holiday decorations, and offer other services that are loosely related to interior design. While you don't need a design background to be successful, it helps if you have an eye for color, shape, texture and form and can translate that into green focal points that will complement beautifully arranged interiors. </p>  <p> Obviously, this is the most technically oriented of the landscape businesses mentioned here, and a bachelor's or master's degree in landscape architecture is generally required to enter the field. And as you may expect, licensed landscape architects charge the highest fees, which is why in May 2004 the middle 50 percent of landscape architects earned between $40,930 and $70,400, according to the Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2006-2007 edition. The highest 10 percent earned more than $90,850. </p>  <p> At Lawn Dawg, growth was propelled by a brave new br, a h, ful of acquisitions and aggressive marketing. In 2009, Campanella recruited a private equity group to recapitalize the business so he could buy out his partner. He brought in a full-time property manager, then centralized sales and processing. “We launched a new and improved Lawn Dawg and that has really paid off for us,” he says. </p>  <p> Still, Cauffman is investing in his team. This year, three additional staff members bring the roster of this $2 million company up to 15 people. Cauffman is positioning the firm for growth by bringing on professionals to manage administrative functions. Now, he’s got an office staff. And that is stressful, in a way, because sales volume is not ramping up significantly. But Cauffman sees potential. “This year, it looks like we’ll be a little better than last year - not hundreds of thousands better, but a little better,” he says. </p>  <p> Industry Snapshot According to the Professional Landcare Network (PLANET), an international association serving lawn care professionals, exterior maintenance contractors, installation/design/building professionals, and interiorscapers, there are an estimated 10,000 individual lawn care service providers and approximately 12,000 landscapers in the United States. These run the gamut from independent procedures to franchises and divisions of large corporate chains. It's believed that the number of businesses could actually be significantly higher because there are so many people doing lawn and landscape maintenance informally and on a cash basis. What is known for sure, based on the Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2006-2007 (U.S. Department of Labor), is that almost 1 out of every 4 landscaping, groundskeeping, nursery, greenhouse and lawn service workers is self-employed and provides maintenance services directly to customers on a contract basis. Of these, about 1 out of every 6 works part time. </p>  <p> It goes without saying that you should take every precaution possible to protect yourself while working. Always wear safety goggles and ear protection, and always remember to let your mower cool down completely before you gas it up. Because the cutting blade can rotate at up to 200 miles per hour, never put your hand into the discharge chute or turn the mower over while the blade is spinning. In addition to the obvious injuries it can inflict, that razor-sharp blade can catapult projectiles like rocks, metal or even compacted grass that can do a body some serious damage. </p>  <p> The economy still isn’t great, Rykbost says. Though, it has picked up from last year. He’s bidding on larger jobs and more of them. “But it’s still a competitive market and you have to keep your numbers very tight,” he says. “And, it’s definitely not 2007 or 2008.” </p>  <p> “Before, we never diversified, and I’ve been in business for 13 years,” Chiellini says. “Halfway through last year, we realized that we better start diversifying, so we aggressively went after office park and municipal work, and now we have something in every arena, so that’s a good place for us now.” As for 2014, Chiellini says he’ll “put on the brakes” and harness the fast 30-35 percent growth the company is experiencing this year “We are getting back to what has helped us stay in business, and that’s getting rid of ‘bad business’ and continuing to find good business,” he says. </p>  <p> "Don't fall off your chair, but part of my success in hiring employees has come from paying way past the industry standard," says Nathan Bowers, owner of Premier Lawn Services in Sykesville, Maryland. "I pay laborers $11 to $14 an hour and my foreman $17 an hour. That may appear like a lot, but I've kept my employees [a long time]. That's pretty much unheard of in this business." </p>  <p> The market they serve is huge. A 2005 survey by Irrigation and Green Industry magazine concluded that the U.S. green industry, which includes lawn and landscape maintenance, landscape contractors, landscape architects, irrigation contractors, and lawn and landscape product suppliers, generates $67 billion to $69 billion annually. Additionally, PLANET estimates that the landscaping services sector alone generates 704,000 jobs and $35.6 million in value-added services annually. </p>  <p> A local landscaper will often give you a free estimate of what it will cost to do work on your yard. However, if you’re not sure what kind of landscaping will best suit your home, you can get a professional landscape design consultation. Here's what it is likely to cost you. </p>  <p> There's one more weather phenomenon you may actually welcome, at least in the northern tier of the country. Snow plowing can be a very lucrative mainstay for or sideline to add to your lawn or landscaping business. It doesn't cost much to launch a snow removal service-basically you need only a snow blade for your mower or truck and some extra advertising efforts. (Food for thought: Michigan landscaper Michael Collins, who runs Celtic Lawn & Landscape with Karen Deighton, reports that he gets 70 percent of his snow plowing business through his website.) Best of all, offering such a service means you'll have a regular income stream even during the slowest part of the year. </p> |How Much Does A Landscaping Company Charge  <p> Now he runs two-man crews - not crews with three, four or five members . The workweek is one day shorter. The business runs Monday through Thursday. “That cuts 10 hours, reduces 20 percent of road time and that means cutting back on 20 percent of my setup and breakdown on jobs, drive time, etc.,” Marsan says . </p>  <h4> Company Landscaping Questions </h4>  <p> The Pros There are many advantages to running a homebased lawn care or landscaping service. You're master of your own destiny, and you can devote as much or as little time to the business as you want. You have a short commute to work if you're based in your own community. You can work at your own pace and at virtually any time during regular daylight hours. You also can enjoy the fresh air, get a good cardiovascular workout, and bulk up your muscles. </p>  <h3> What Does Landscaping Company Do </h3>  <p> Joshua Cauffman launched GreenRoots Landscaping in the Philadelphia area in 2009. Tough is what he knows - business has never been all that different. But what has changed since his first year operating is the size of the design/build projects his company performs. </p>  <p> However, according to industry experts and other business owners we spoke to, $10 an hour is about the going hourly rate for employees, which, compared to the current minimum wage, looks pretty darned good. Some owners, like Steve Mager, a lawn care business owner in Minnesota who also does chemical applications, have a sliding wage scale. Steve's base wage is $10, but he pays more-around $15 an hour-to employees with certain qualifications, such as those with a spotless driving record or a pesticide certification. </p>  <p> “The recession really allowed me to grow up a little,” says Strauser, 36. I started the business when I was in my 20s, and I was full bore until I was 30.” Slower times gave Strauser breathing room to stop, plan and build a strategy for what’s next at his firm. And, like most companies, he got just uncomfortable enough to learn why running lean is critical. In 2001, he launched a Working Smarter Challenge. “We started to basically look at how we do things from an operational and financial standpoint,” he says. </p>  <h3> How Much Does A Lawn Mowing Service Company Charge? </h3>  <p> Weathering the Storm(s) Then there are weather issues to contend with. Even in the sunniest of climes, you are likely to have days when you can't mow or plant or prune-like when the winds reach hurricane speed or you notice your neighbor is building an ark. There's not much you can do when grass and landscaping are wet-except maybe catch up on paperwork, lust over equipment catalogs and read e read e and lust over equipment catalogs-mail.} That's why many green industry providers choose to work a five-day workweek, leaving Saturdays (and Sundays, if necessary) unscheduled just in case the weather wreaks havoc with their work plans. Alternatively, you can work longer hours on a regular maintenance day to catch up-chances are people won't even blink if you're out merrily mowing or trimming as the sun is setting because it means they don't have to. </p>  <p> Guesstimating Your Worth Another important part of the job is providing estimates to prospective clients. Unfortunately, this is an inexact science, at best. Most of the owners we spoke with "guesstimate" how much time it will take them to mow a homeowner's property, then multiply that by a price per hour. The problem with this method is that land features like slopes and ornamental landscaping can affect the time. For example, let's say it will take you 70 minutes to mow a 10,000-square-foot property using a 22-inch mower. But toss in a backyard that's landscaped with driftwood and rocks and has a raised vegetable garden, and your estimate is no longer quite as accurate. </p>  <p> Meanwhile, business is steadily growing as consumers in the Twin Cities market loosen up spending. Clifton says 2011 and 2012 were the best years on record for Southview Designs. “I think we were a little bit on the front end of the recovery due to all the promotion we have done,” he says. “When people came back into the market (to spend), they were willing to take a look at us. </p>  <h3> How Much Does A Landscape Design Consultation Cost? </h3>  <p> When you establish your base wage, keep in mind that in service industries like lawn care, it's not unusual for workers to change jobs to nab as little as a 25-cent-per-hour pay increase. So it's a good idea to ask around to see what other service providers are paying in your area and set your base pay rate accordingly. </p>  <h3> How To Start A Lawn Care Or Landscaping Business  </h3>  <p> Currently, the company is working with corporate clients who contract out an array of services, from plumbing and electric to landscaping - whatever happens on the property. Foret Group sees an chance to serve as a reputable single point of contact. Essentially, the firm is working as a general contractor of trades, which means building relationships to fulfill large, complex facilities management contracts. </p>  <p> Another good way to determine your rate is to figure out how much it would cost you to, say, install sod (materials plus labor), and then divide that amount by the number of hours it would take you to complete the job. Add a profit margin, and you'll have a number you can use. </p>  <h3> How Much Does Landscaping Cost? </h3>  <p> You also could get creative like Albert Towns Jr., a Detroit lawn care service provider who supplements his wintertime income both by putting up Christmas lights and by shoveling sidewalks for a number of elderly people. Then, in the spring, he does in-ground sprinkler system work to get his income stream off to a good start. </p>  <h3> How Much Does A Landscaping Company Charge </h3>  <p> Vermont is a different market, Marsan admits. And in his region, which is rural, the switch to commercial was a survival move. “We’re very much unlike the suburbs of Boston where there are a lot of affluent single-family residents,” Marsan says, calling central Vermont a somewhat limited market. “The best way for us to afford our overhead and succeed was to concentrate on what was available, and there was a pretty good opportunity in the commercial end of things.” </p>  <p> This assertive growth will continue. And so will the firm’s careful watch over the budget. “We negotiate everything from print material to trucks and equipment,” Campanella says of a significant change in purchasing since the financial downturn. “We make sure we are getting the best value across the board.” </p>  <h4>   </h4>  <p> Fortunately, Strauser had saved when times were good and had the reserves to make some moves. “Before, we were so busy getting work done, we didn’t have time to spend money, really,” he says. From the time he started the business in 1998 until 2008, “It was pretty much, the sky is the limit,” and the business grew 20 to 30 percent each year. Strauser played his spending smart during that time. </p>  <h4> How I Charge Landscaping Jobs Hourly Vs By The Job - Prices </h4>  <p> Reality Check This all sounds pretty appealing, doesn't it? But of course, every Garden of Eden has a serpent, and lawn care and landscaping businesses have quite a few of their own coiled up and waiting to strike. To begin, you have to be a lot more adept at mowing, trimming and pruning than the average person and mowing.} That means you'll have to invest some time in learning gardening basics and techniques. You'll have to be a disciplined self-starter who can ignore the call of a glorious spring day and diligently service your clients instead of heading for the lake or golf course. You have to be physically fit and able to handle the rigors of the job, which can include lifting heavy equipment off and onto trailers, and wielding bulky handheld implements for hours at a time. You'll be handling potentially dangerous machinery and hazardous chemicals. And you'll have to be a very savvy business manager who can administer cash flow, invent advertising and marketing campaigns, and implement a survival plan that will take you through the lean winter months. </p>  <p> Landscaper: In the most general sense, this is the type of person who installs and maintains plants, flowers, trees, sod, and other natural materials like rocks and mulch. Lawn care often is part of the landscape maintenance professional's menu of services, plus he or she may also offer basic design services (a good eye and an equally good design software package make it possible). Finally, landscapers may offer add-on services, such as sprinkler installation or hardscape construction, to stay busy. We'll discuss the numerous ways you can pump up your business a little later. Most states require landscapers to be licensed. Check with your state's department of licensing, labor or contracting board to find out the requirements. </p>  <p> Earnings Exactly how much can you earn? The sky's truly the limit. The lawn care and landscaping business owners we interviewed for this book earned anywhere from $5,000 to $50,000 in their first year, and as much as $160,000 to $250,000 once they were in business a few years. They offer services ranging from basic mowing and trimming to landscape design, installation and maintenance, and chemical application Lawn & Landscape magazine's 2005 State of the Industry Report offers additional insight into how much a lawn and landscaping company owner can earn. In a survey of Lawn & Landscape readers who own companies of all sizes, the average salary of the owner/president whose company revenues were less than $200,000 during 2005 was $31,273. Owners/presidents in companies with revenues above $200,000 earned $68,859 on average. </p>  <p> “This might not be the story you were expecting to hear,” says Jim Campanella of Lawn Dawg, Nashua, N.H. His business doubled since 2009, from $5.6 to $12 million. “We got hit just as hard here as everywhere else in the country,” he adds. So, the market in upstate New York wasn’t especially kind. </p> |What Does Landscaping Company Do  <p> How often do you get to make a $30,000 decision ? It's important that such decisions not be based on a whim. In making a $30,000 decision about a stock investment, you'd want hard facts to guide you, right? At the very least, you'd like to hear some expert opinions. You should seek the same kinds of guides in the matter of home landscaping design. </p>  <p> Some home owners like to color coordinate their house and their landscaping. That is easy enough, but how far should you go in harmonizing house and yard aesthetically? For example, if the style of your home does not qualify it as a "cottage," can you still landscape in the cottage-garden style? I would say yes, but only you can decide on the degree to which you should strive for such harmony, because everyone's taste is different. There's no doubt that some types of hardscape features fit better with some houses than with others. A rustic-style deck, for example, will look much better attached to a log cabin than to an ultra-modern contemporary.  </p>  <h3> How Much Does A Landscaping Company Charge </h3>  <p> Large corporations have company grounds to be maintained, schools and universities have campus grounds to keep, cities and towns have public parks that need maintenance and improvements, and zoos and theme parks need landscape design solutions as well. All of these are potential clients or employers for a landscaper. On a smaller scale, many landscapers earn a living planting seasonal flowers and trimming trees and shrubs. This sort of work doesn't require much equipment or training, so it can be a good stepping stone to a career change, providing an opportunity to get one's feet wet without necessarily quitting the day job. </p>  <p> Many simply maintain whatever landscaping is already in existence, and are not much more than glorified lawn mowing services. Others may have landscape designers and offer full services including hardscaping. </p>  <p> Simply put, if you can look out your window and see a fixed feature in your yard affecting the overall aesthetics or practical functioning of your property, then that feature is part of the "landscaping" of the property. Note also that some practical features of one's landscaping, such as underground drainage systems, are of critical importance even though they exist unseen.  </p>  <p> While it will continually be maintained every year as a parking lot, it will look appropriately as though it belongs inside the fences of Augusta National, imagine parking... a few years from now in a very beautiful park, and walking to the admissions gate without having any interference by cars or carts. It will be a straight, uninterrupted walk, a beautiful walk. We're pretty good at landscaping, as you know. </p>  <h4> What Do Landscaping Companies Do And Why Hire Them </h4>  <p> Answering the question will clarify your priorities and help establish an overarching idea for your home landscaping projects. If you are home landscaping for yourself as a lifelong resident on the property, you need only consult your own tastes. But if your property is fated to be a real estate listing, you need to think when it comes to "curb appeal": You are essentially landscaping for other people's tastes -- namely, the tastes of potential real estate buyers. </p>  <h3> What Do People Want From A Landscaping Company?  </h3>  <p> Achieving harmony is sometimes possible intuitively. But if you are more serious about complementing your house with your landscaping, you really need to take matters to the next level: landscape design, which is essentially an art form (although this discipline never loses sight of practical considerations, as well). </p>  <h3> What Does Landscaping Company Do </h3>  <p> My favorite thing is landscaping. I love landscaping. And so what I'll do is, mostly I put language into search engines, and if I want to look, like, at tulip gardens, or, like, Georgian gardens, i love English gardens, how they're laid out. Japanese gardens, Asian gardens. So, I'm kind of a frustrated landscaper. </p>  <p> Before we begin, there is a fundamental question to ponder. Should a house and its landscaping be harmonious with each other? I'm not talking about practical concerns, such as planting shade trees to the south of your home to reduce energy costs. No, I'm talking about appearance. Should the way your house looks influence landscaping decisions such as plant selection and arrangement, or whether to build a wooden deck versus a brick patio? </p>  <p> As in other aspects of your life, some of the best home landscaping decisions result from learning what not to do. For example, some do-it-yourselfers who are excited about the idea of starting from a blank slate decide that they will begin a home landscaping makeover by removing a large tree from their landscape. The American Nursery & Landscape Association, however, points out how bad an idea this can be: </p>  <p> Now that you have read my overview of the different types of landscaping work that you can do to improve a property, you may be interested in consulting the following articles for related information: </p>  <p> Hours may be long, working weekends and overtime, or they may be nonexistent during the winter months when the landscaping business slows down considerably. Landscaping is not a stress-free job by any stretch, with deadlines and profit margins to keep even the most motivated worker on their toes. </p>  <p> They're gonna have to pry the hose out of my cold, dead fingers, i have a yard where I have invested money in the landscaping, I've got a dog that likes to run in the yard, I have family that likes to come over and visit. And it's unfair to force me to cut my use 36 percent. </p>  <p> While the above furnishes a straightforward, working definition of the term, "landscaping," first-time property owners will often profit more from an overview of the kind of work that they can do (or hire a professional to do) in order to improve their yards. So below, I will offer a quick glance at some of the various kinds of landscaping features you can install on your property. Not every homeowner will want to include everything discussed below, but most everyone will want to include at least some of features on this list. </p>  <p> But what might those guides be? And how do you ascertain what types of home landscaping represent the current trends for the real estate market? Fortunately, the resources for home landscaping design ideas are so numerous that your challenge will be not in finding the ideas, but in sifting through all of them and prioritizing. In addition to the selling trends, you'll always want to provide your home landscaping with as much potential as possible for fall color and beautiful winter scenes -- because this never goes out of style. </p> <br><br><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m8!1m3!1d11999.243940327775!2d-72.967221!3d41.247675!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0x4b5862034f2f9273!2sElm+City+Landscape+and+Site+Development%2C+LLC.!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1530625150476" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p><a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/localbusinesses/West-Haven-Landscaping-&-Hardscaping-(203)-903-5606.html">Landscaping</a><br> <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/localbusinesses/West-Haven-Landscaping-&-Hardscaping-(203)-903-5606.html">Hardscaping</a><br> <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/localbusinesses/West-Haven-Landscaping-&-Hardscaping-(203)-903-5606.html">Patio Contractor</a><br> <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/localbusinesses/West-Haven-Landscaping-&-Hardscaping-(203)-903-5606.html">Masonry Contractor</a><br> <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/localbusinesses/West-Haven-Landscaping-&-Hardscaping-(203)-903-5606.html">Lawncare</a><br> <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/localbusinesses/West-Haven-Landscaping-&-Hardscaping-(203)-903-5606.html">Snow Removal</a><br> </p><br></body><br></html>
